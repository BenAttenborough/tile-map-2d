WIP: Attempt to make a 2d tile map utility for Love2d.
The intention is to create a tool for making Zelda like games.
A map will be stored to represent a world. Each element of the map will represent a tile.
The dev can input a table with the map information and a spritesheet and the utility will draw the map.
Extending on this the map could extend beyond the edges of the screen and be scrollable.
